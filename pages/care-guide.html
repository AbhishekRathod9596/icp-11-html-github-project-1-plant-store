        <b>1.Light Requirements</b> <br><br>
        <img src="./../images/plant-details-imgs/sunlight.jpg" alt="sunlight" height="200"><br>
        Different plants have varying light needs. Most tropical houseplants, like Monsteras, Pothos, and Peace Lilies, thrive in bright, indirect light, meaning they should be placed near a window where sunlight is filtered through a curtain or shade. Plants like cacti and succulents require direct sunlight and should be positioned on a sunny windowsill or in an area that receives at least 6 hours of sun per day. On the other hand, some plants, such as ZZ plants, Snake plants, and ferns, can adapt to low-light conditions, making them ideal for offices or rooms with limited natural light. If natural light is insufficient, grow lights can be used to supplement plant growth. <br>
        <b><u>Bright, indirect light:</u></b> Most indoor plants (e.g., Monstera, Pothos, Peace Lily) thrive in filtered sunlight.<br>
        <b><u>Direct sunlight: </u></b>Succulents, cacti, and some flowering plants need direct sun exposure.<br>
        <b><u>Low light:</u></b> ZZ plants, Snake plants, and ferns can tolerate low-light conditions.

        <b>2.Watering </b><br><br>
        <img src="./../images/plant-details-imgs/watering.jpg" alt="watering" height="200"><br>
        Watering is crucial but should be done carefully, as both overwatering and underwatering can be harmful. A general rule is to check the soil moisture before wateringâ€”stick your finger about 1â€“2 inches into the soil; if it feels dry, itâ€™s time to water. Most tropical plants need watering once a week, while succulents and cacti require watering every 2â€“3 weeks, as they store water in their leaves. Plants that prefer high humidity, like ferns and Calatheas, may need watering 2â€“3 times a week, especially in dry conditions. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so always ensure pots have drainage holes to allow excess water to escape. Using room-temperature water is recommended, as cold water can shock the roots.<br>
        <b><u>Check soil moisture: </u></b>Stick your finger 1-2 inches into the soil; if dry, it's time to water.<br>
        <b><u>Avoid overwatering: </u></b>Most plants suffer from root rot if they sit in water for too long.<br>
        <b><u>Water frequency: </u></b>
        <ul>
            <li>Succulents & cacti: Every 2â€“3 weeks</li>
            <li>Tropical plants: Once a week</li>
            <li>Ferns & moisture-loving plants: 2â€“3 times a week</li>
        </ul>

        <b>3.Humidity and Temperature </b><br><br>
        <img src="./../images/plant-details-imgs/humidity and temperature.webp" alt="humidity and temperature" height="200"><br>
        Most houseplants thrive in a temperature range of 65â€“75Â°F (18â€“24Â°C), avoiding sudden temperature fluctuations, cold drafts, or excessive heat. Some plants, particularly tropical varieties, require higher humidity levels to prevent their leaves from drying out. To increase humidity, mist plants occasionally, use a pebble tray filled with water beneath the plant pot, or place a humidifier nearby. Low-humidity plants, such as cacti, succulents, and Snake plants, can tolerate drier air and require less moisture in their environment.<br>
        <b><u>Ideal temperature: </u></b>65â€“75Â°F (18â€“24Â°C). Avoid cold drafts and extreme heat.<br>
        <b><u>Increase humidity: </u></b>Mist tropical plants, use a pebble tray, or place a humidifier nearby.<br>
        <b><u>Low-humidity plants: </u></b>Cacti, succulents, and Snake plants can tolerate dry air.<br>

        <b>4.Pruning and Maintenance </b><br><br>
        <img src="./../images/plant-details-imgs/pruning-and-maintenance.jpg" alt="pruning-and-maintenance" height="180"><br>
        Regular maintenance keeps plants looking their best and encourages healthy growth. Prune dead or yellowing leaves to prevent disease and improve plant appearance. Some plants, such as Pothos and Philodendrons, benefit from trimming leggy stems to promote bushier growth. Rotating plants every few weeks ensures even light exposure, preventing them from leaning toward one direction. Dusting leaves with a damp cloth removes dirt and allows for better photosynthesis. Some plants, like Peace Lilies, benefit from occasional showers to wash off dust and keep leaves hydrated.<br>
        <b><u>Trim dead leaves & flowers: </u></b>Encourages new growth and prevents disease.<br>
        <b><u>Rotate plants: </u></b>Ensures even growth by exposing all sides to light.<br>
        <b><u>Dust leaves: </u></b>Clean with a damp cloth to improve photosynthesis.<br>

        <b>5.Fertilizing </b><br><br>
        <img src="./../images/plant-details-imgs/fertilizing.jpg" alt="fertilizing" height="210"><br>
        Plants require nutrients to grow, and fertilization should be done primarily during the growing season (spring and summer). A balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength can be applied once a month for most houseplants. Succulents and cacti need less frequent feeding, about every 2â€“3 months, while flowering plants may require more nutrients to support blooms. During fall and winter, plant growth slows, so fertilizing should be reduced or stopped altogether. Over-fertilization can cause salt buildup in the soil, which may harm the roots, so itâ€™s best to follow specific recommendations for each plant type.<br>
        <b><u>Spring & summer: </u></b>Feed plants monthly with a balanced liquid fertilizer.<br>
        <b><u>Fall & winter: </u></b>Reduce or stop fertilizing as plant growth slows.<br>
