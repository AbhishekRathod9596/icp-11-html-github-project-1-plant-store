    <h1><u>Tips and Tricks to Maintain your plants</u>:</h1>
    <p>
        Different types of plants will have different individual care needs, but what I wanted to cover is general care, and just little tips/tricks that I wish I knew earlier that wouldâ€™ve made my life easier
    </p>
    <p>
        When it comes to caring for plants I try to learn to a â€˜less is moreâ€™ approach. Plants are self sufficient. They grow in nature on their own without any help. You just need to make sure they have the basic ingredients they need - and then let them take care of themselves.<br>
    </p>
        <br>
    <p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>
        <b>Create a soil blend:</b>When weâ€™re talking about planting things up, I find that creating a soil blend is a key to a happy plant.A soil blend will allow your plants to â€˜breatheâ€™ easier in the soil and allow for better drainage. A chunkier soil mix will also encourage your plant to develop a stronger root system, and when we have a better root system, we get a better plant.

        </li>
        <li>
        <b>Dust Your Plant leaves:</b>House plants can collect a lot of dust.I like to either just use a cloth and water, or a white oil spray and a cloth. White oil is also a preventative for bugs.Another option you can also use is neem oil to act as a preventive measure for insects and fungus.<br>
        <img src="../images/plant-care/t-2.jpg" height="100px">
        <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>Plants need more water when theyâ€™re actively growing:</b>When a plant is developing a new leaf make sure it gets more water than usual, as they will drink more when theyâ€™re actively growing.If you see one of your plants putting out a bunch of new growth, check the soil! The soil will probably be dry much faster than usual.<br>
        <img src="../images/plant-care/t-3.jpg" height="100px">
        <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>Make Sure Pots Have Drainage Holes:</b>Having a way for pots to drain is vital for your plant and the soil. Proper drainage allows the roots to receive air, rather than sitting in water and suffocating the roots.<br>
